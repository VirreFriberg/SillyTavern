The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called ''tango'' or ''tungul'' (a [[day of rest]]) entails a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the ''bayah'' (rice beer), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practice during the festivities.\n\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also<ref name=\"tourism.gov.ph\" /> been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao's rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members.\n\n==== Sri Lanka ====\n[[File:BeFunky_Chromatic_1.jpg|thumb|Indian women separating rice from straw]]\nRice is the staple food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as \"Maha\", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as \"Yala\", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent. Traditional rice varieties are now making a comeback with the recent interest in green foods.\n\n==== Thailand ====\n{{main|Rice production in Thailand}}\n[[File:Cambodian_farmers_planting_rice.jpg|thumb|Cambodian women planting rice.]]\nRice is the main export of Thailand, especially white jasmine rice 105 (Dok Mali 105).<ref>The genetic wonder of Thai rice, 1998</ref> Thailand has a large number of rice varieties, 3,500 kinds with different characters, and five kinds of wild rice cultivates.<ref>Science and technology with Thai rice, National center for genetic engineering, 2003</ref> In each region of the country there are different rice seed types. Their use depends on weather, atmosphere, and topography.<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998\">The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998</ref>\n\nThe northern region has both lowlands and high lands. The farmers' usual crop is non-glutinous rice<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 44, 1998\" /> such as Niew Sun Pah Tong rice. This rice is naturally protected from leaf disease, and its paddy (unmilled rice) ({{lang-th|ข้าวเปลือก}}) has a brown color.<ref>Punkhao (Niew San Pah Tong), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref> The northeastern region is a large area where farmers can cultivate about 36 million square meters of rice. Although most of it is plains and dry areas,<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998\">The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998</ref> white jasmine rice 105—the most famous Thai rice—can be grown there. White jasmine rice was developed in [[Chonburi Province]] first and after that grown in many areas in the country, but the rice from this region has a high quality, because it is softer, whiter, and more fragrant.<ref>The genetic wonder of Thai rice, p. 110,1998</ref> This rice can resist drought, acidic soil, and alkaline soil.<ref>Punkhao (Khao Dawk Mali 105), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref>\n\nThe central region is mostly composed of plains. Most farmers grow Jao rice.<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998\" /> For example, Pathum Thani 1 rice which has qualities similar to white jasmine 105 rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch, and the cooked rice also has fragrant grains.<ref>Punkhao (Pathum Thani 1), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref>\n\nIn the southern region, most farmers transplant around boundaries to the flood plains or on the plains between mountains. Farming in the region is slower than other regions because the rainy season comes later.<ref name=\"The ecology of life, p. 45, 1998\" /> The popular rice varieties in this area are the Leb Nok Pattani seeds, a type of Jao rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch, and it can be processed to make noodles.<ref>Punkhao ( Leb Nok Pattani), www.brrd.in.th, 2013</ref>\n\n==== Companion plant ====\nOne of the earliest known examples of [[companion plant]]ing is the growing of rice with [[Azolla]], the mosquito fern, which covers the top of a fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.\n[[File:Leiden_University_Library_-_Seikei_Zusetsu_vol._15,_page_022_-_両穂稲_-_Oryza_sativa_L.,_1804.jpg|thumb|Double-headed rice, illustration from the Japanese agricultural encyclopedia Seikei Zusetsu (1804)]]\n\n=== Middle East and the Mediterranean Basin ===\nAsiatic rice (Oryza sativa), although a latecomer to Mediterranean agriculture, was relatively widespread in antiquity and was not a product of the Islamic Agricultural Revolution. During the [[Hellenistic period]], rice was well known as far west as [[Parthia]], in modern northeastern [[Iran]]. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] (first century BCE) recognized rice as a significant Indian crop during the subcontinent's busy agricultural season. [[Strabo]] (first century CE) reported that rice was widely grown in [[Bactria]], [[Babylonia|Babylon]], [[Susa|Susis]], and also in [[Roman Syria|Lower Syria]], based on second century BCE author Aristobulus. The crop traveled to [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]) during the early centuries CE.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |last=Decker |first=Michael |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316430311 |title=Tilling the Hateful Earth: Agricultural Production and Trade in the Late Antique East |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-956528-3 |location=Oxford |pages=109–110 |oclc=316430311}}</ref>\n\nTexts from the late first and early second centuries imply that [[Jews|Jewish]] farmers introduced rice to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Early Roman period]]. Palestine's main crop was fine, large kernel rice. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (3-4th centuries CE), rice was grown in [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], [[Banias|Paneas-Caesarea Phillipi]], and the Chrysopolis area to the north of the [[Sea of Galilee]] (in modern-day [[Israel]]).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Galen]] recommended the grain as a medicament in the second century, and his disciple [[Oribasius]] followed him in the fourth century.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the time the Muslims arrived in Iraq, rice was already widely farmed throughout the Sasanian kingdom. The [[Babylonian Talmud]] describes its Mesopotamian cultivation, and implies it was an important part of the cuisine of [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Jews in Babylon]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Following the Islamic conquest, its cultivation moved north to [[Nisibin]], the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] (in [[Gilan province|Gilan]] and [[Mazanderan]] provinces of Iran)<ref name=\"pazuki\" /> and then beyond the Muslim world into the valley of the [[Volga]]. In Egypt, rice is mainly grown in the [[Nile Delta]]. In Palestine, rice came to be grown in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Rice is also grown in Saudi Arabia at [[Al-Ahsa Oasis]] and in [[Yemen]].<ref name=\"Watson\" />\n\n=== Caribbean and Latin America ===\nMost of the rice used today in the cuisine of the Americas is not native but was introduced to Latin America and the Caribbean by [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans]] at an early date. However, there are at least two native (endemic) species of rice present in the Amazon region of South America, and one or both were used by the indigenous inhabitants of the region to create the domesticated form [[Oryza sp.]], some 4000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hilbert|first1=Lautaro|last2=Neves|first2=Eduardo Góes|last3=Pugliese|first3=Francisco|last4=Whitney|first4=Bronwen S.|last5=Shock|first5=Myrtle|last6=Veasey|first6=Elizabeth|last7=Zimpel|first7=Carlos Augusto|last8=Iriarte|first8=José|year=2017|title=Evidence for mid-Holocene rice domestication in the Americas|url=http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/32419/1/Hilbert%20et%20al%202017.pdf|journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution|volume=1|issue=11|pages=1693–1698|doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0322-4|pmid=28993622|s2cid=22917055|access-date=2021-03-29|archive-date=2018-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720040006/http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/32419/1/Hilbert%20et%20al%202017.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonizers]] introduced [[Asian rice]] to Mexico in the 1520s at [[Veracruz]], and the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and their African slaves introduced it at about the same time to [[State of Brazil|colonial Brazil]].<ref name=\"slaveryinamerica.org\">West, Jean M.{{cite web|title=Rice and Slavery|url=http://slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101092714/http://slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm|archive-date=January 1, 2007|access-date=June 24, 2013}}.

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and \n\npestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia sericea|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of waterpower for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

The Australian rice industry is somewhat opportunistic, with the area planted varying significantly from season to season depending on water allocations in the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] irrigation regions.\n\n[[Australian Aboriginal]] people have harvested native rice varieties for thousands of years, and there are ongoing efforts to grow commercial quantities of these species.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 15, 2014|title=Wild for Aussie rice|website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2014-05-15/native-australian-wild-rice-indigenous/5455764|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223035527/http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2014-05-15/native-australian-wild-rice-indigenous/5455764|archive-date=December 23, 2017|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Alpine Rice &#124; Australia's first commercial native grain crop. © 2013|url=http://alpinerice.com.au/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227061914/http://alpinerice.com.au/|archive-date=December 27, 2017|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}{{Rice}}\n\n[[Category:Rice]]\n[[Category:History of agriculture]]",
